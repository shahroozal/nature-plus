# Nature+

Nature+ is a white noise generator unlike any other. Do you enjoy hearing birds chirp? Or experience a warm day on a field? Do you prefer a rainy night? You can even make it rain more or less, or maybe add thunder! By simply moving your finger on a slider, you are able to generate and mix high-quality sounds and environments to help you sleep, work, or simply relax. Each environment is designed with stunning graphics and animations, from a sunny day to a stormy night. Modular sounds are automatically added to each environment in order to make it a one of a kind experience.

We'd be happy to hear your feedback and suggestions!
